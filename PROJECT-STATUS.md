## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **MCP Integration** - Dramatically accelerated development
2. **Copilot Coding Agent** - Excellent for comprehensive refactoring
3. **Security-First Approach** - Paid off immediately
4. **Markdown-Based Planning** - Clear communication and history
5. **Deployment Early** - Found real-world issues

### What To Do Better Next Time
1. Add security from Day 1 (not as afterthought)
2. Integrate database earlier (MVP with persistence from start)
3. Write tests alongside features (not after)
4. Performance monitoring from launch
5. User feedback collection earlier

### Platform Insights
1. **Monorepo timing** - Right to plan before implementing
2. **Plugin architecture** - Good to design before third app
3. **Component library** - Extract when pattern emerges
4. **Shared authentication** - Plan early, implement when second app ready
